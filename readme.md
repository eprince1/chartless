Chartless is an open-source npm package that empowers developers to effortlessly generate headless SVG charts. It provides a simple and versatile API that enables developers to create customized charts without any rendering dependencies. With Chartless, you can quickly generate SVG charts and integrate them into your projects with ease.

## Features

- **SVG Charts**: Chartless focuses on generating SVG-based charts, providing you with the flexibility to style, animate, and manipulate the charts using standard SVG attributes.

- **Simple API**: The API is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand. You can create various types of charts with just a few lines of code.

- **Customizable**: Customize your charts by tweaking various parameters like colors, labels, data points, and more.
